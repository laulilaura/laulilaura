## My Experiences

### Work experience

I had the opportunity to do a 3-month internship in the Department of Isère in Grenoble in June 2021. I was able to develop my skills in web application development, by initiating the redesign of a php application to Asp.net Core.

🎯 As part of my studies, I'm looking for an international #internship in IT development.
This professional adventure would start in June 2023, for a period of 2.5 months.
The desire to perfect my English, to discover another culture and to improve my skills in software engeneering pushes me today to do everything I can to find my ideal internship ! 🕵️‍♀️
Proficient in OOP, IT analysis and design, Web and database, I have the will to use all my knowledge in an IT team, and bring my French touch 🥖

🔁 I remain open to any proposal regarding my training. Feel free to reach me out via email or LinkedIn :

🥷🏻 I am a great adventurer in search of new adventures 
I had the chance to travel a lot in my free time and had the opportunity to discover many cultures. I like to adapt to any situation and learn new things every day !

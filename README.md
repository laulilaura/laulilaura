## My Experiences

### Work experience

👥 June, Jully and August 2021 - I had the opportunity to do a 3-month internship in the Department of Isère in Grenoble in June 2021. I was able to develop my skills in web application development, by initiating the redesign of a php application to Asp.net Core.

🌳 June and Jully 2023 - The dendrochronology researchers at the University of Liège, in collaboration with the Royal Institute for Artistic Heritage in Brussels, would like to create an application to meet their needs. I spent 9 weeks doing an internship at the University of Liège to work on this project, called Deep In Heritage. I joined a team of three developers to design and implement an interoperable database and an accessible interface for performing actions on dendrochronological data.
